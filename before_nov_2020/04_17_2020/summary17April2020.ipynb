    "\n",
    "We have implemented the option to specify the biharmonic horizontal viscosity coefficient (AH)\n",
    "via a user-specified (Biharmonic) grid Reynolds number (input parameter RE_AH).\n",
    "If RE_AH is nonzero, AH is scaled so that the biharmonic Reynolds number is equal to this.\n",
    "RE_AH is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$RE\\_AH = \\frac{U \\Delta x3}{AH}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta x3$ is the harmonic mean of the squares of the grid^(3/2).\n",

    "A set of experiments convering a rage of RE_AH values can be found at:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Cases with large RE_AH values (e.g. 100) were too noisy. The smallest value tested was RE_AH = 5. In this case, grid-scale noise is significantly reduced (although it still occurs, specially in high latitudes). However, AH is too large to sustain a good EUC.\n",

    "### Biharmonic controlled via Leith nonlinear eddy viscosity\n",
    "\n",
    "This was somthing that Scott had aleady coded in MOM6. There was a mistake in the code which is not corrected. Three experiments were performed to check how different values of ```LEITH_BI_CONST``` affect the solution. LEITH_BI_CONST = 128.0 (G58) seems the best. \n"
